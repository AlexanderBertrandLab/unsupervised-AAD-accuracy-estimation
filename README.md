# Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation for Correlation-based Stimulus Decoders in Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD)

If this code has been useful to you, please cite [1].

## About

This repository includes the MATLAB code for Algorithm 1 in [1], i.e., the unsupervised AAD accuracy estimation for correlation-based stimulus decoders. 

Developed and tested in MATLAB R2021b.

Note: The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in MATLAB is required to compute confidence intervals.
